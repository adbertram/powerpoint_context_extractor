{context}

## Recommendation Requirements

Provide a recommendation that:

1. Identifies the slide's primary purpose
2. Suggests when in a presentation it would be most effective
3. Describes what type of content or message it's designed to convey
4. Mentions any special features (animations, layout) that enhance its effectiveness

Write in a professional, helpful tone as if advising a presenter preparing their talk.

## Example Output

Here is an example of the output you should generate:

"""
Features the subtitle “Q2” to indicate a follow-up question. It displays updated poll results: 70% of people love pineapple on pizza (highlighted in pink) and 30% loathe it (in purple). This setup is ideal for showing changes over time or between audience segments. A morphing transition should be used to visually emphasize the shift in sentiment. Narration can provide context or offer reasons behind the change. This format works well for illustrating trends, presenting interactive polls with dynamic results, or demonstrating the impact of a new idea or intervention.
